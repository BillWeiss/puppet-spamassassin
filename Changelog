1.0.4:
    A bunch of help from @mark0n:
    - Configure listening IP instead of assuming localhost
    - Put more of the default files in place instead of assuming the
      package Did The Right Thing
    - Parameterized the class to support all the options

1.0.3:
    Had to change case in the module name.

1.0.2:
    I had a goofy typo in 1.0.1, it didn't actually become a module.
    Fail.

1.0.1:
    Initial fork from Garrett's 1.0.0. Contains my Debian additions which
    are somewhat tested (namely, I'm using them).

1.0.0:
    Same as https://github.com/ghoneycutt/puppet-spamassassin 1.0.0
